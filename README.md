## Planning/Coding Experience
I began planning the front end of the Dream Catcher application by writing user stories and wireframes. I wrote down steps to acheive each of the user stories. I started each day with a goal for the day, and made sure to overcome anything that was blocking me from making progress. I began by testing the auth that was given the template to verify it worked and figure out where I need to start. I started with creating each CRUD action for the user's dreams. I made sure to include ownership for each CRUD action. I then moved onto organization and styling. I finished by deploying the site to Heroku and testing the deployed version as well. This is the client side of the Dream Catcher app which works with the server side back end for full functionality. Please refer to links above.

## Unsolved Problems

1.I am a user and I want to Sign In and view my dream log only once I'm signed in.
2. I am a user and I want to Sign out.
3. I am a user and I want to change password.
4. I am a user and I want to log a new dream.
5. I am a user and I want to edit a currently logged dream.
6. I am a user and I want to delete a currently logged dream.
7. I am a user and I want to find the meaning of my dream. (possibly)
